- Delete task
- Display tasks sorted by deadline
- Persistent storage using JSON

### OOP Concepts Demonstrated

## Task 2 – Self-study (50%)

### Data Structure: Heap (Max Heap)

A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.

### Algorithm: Heap Sort

Heap Sort is implemented using a Max Heap.

Time Complexity:
- Insert: O(log n)
- Extract Max: O(log n)
- Heap Sort: O(n log n)
